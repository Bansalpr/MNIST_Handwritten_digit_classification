# MNIST_Handwritten_digit_classification
MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits.Every MNIST data point, every image, can be thought of as an array of numbers describing how dark each pixel is. Since each image has 28 by 28 pixels, we get a 28x28 array. We can flatten each array into a 28âˆ—28=784 dimensional vector.
